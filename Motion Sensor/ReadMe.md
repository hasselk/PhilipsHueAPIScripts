# Philips Hue Motion Sensor Scripts
Because Philips use the Motion Sensor only for switching lights on or off, this space contains some example scripts to do more with the motion sensor. Keep in mind that all scripts published here are examples only. You may use, modify and distribute it at your own risk.

## Disclaimer
All scripts are (hopefully) well documented, if you find an error or have some improvements for me just drop me a message. All scripts are provided to you "as is" with no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind.
